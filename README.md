# React + TypeScript + Vite + Styled-Components

## This project is a recreation of the Evrone website

## Live Demo: evrone-frontend.vercel.app

### Key Features:

#### React & TypeScript:

The project was developed using React for building a dynamic and component-based user interface.
TypeScript was employed to ensure type safety, which enhances the development process by catching potential errors during compilation and improving code quality.

#### Styled Components::

Styled Components were used for styling the website. This allowed for scoped CSS within components, resulting in a more modular and maintainable codebase.
Dynamic theming and responsiveness were handled through styled components, ensuring the design adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes.

#### Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. This was achieved using CSS media queries and flexible layouts, ensuring a smooth user experience across all platforms.

#### Vercel Deployment:

The application is deployed on Vercel, offering fast and reliable hosting with automatic updates on every push to the GitHub repository.

#### Clean Code and Scalability:

The use of React functional components, hooks, and TypeScript interfaces resulted in a clean, organized, and scalable code structure. This allows for easy updates and the addition of new features in the future.

##### This project demonstrates my ability to recreate complex designs and implement them using modern frontend technologies. It also highlights my attention to detail when building responsive and accessible websites.
